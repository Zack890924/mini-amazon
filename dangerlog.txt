Before 4/11
Situation: We discussed the Protocol Buffer (protobuf) message design with our interoperability group (IG) and finalized the communication formats for Amazon and UPS.

4/12
Situation: We determined the project architecture: backend using Spring Boot + Maven, frontend using React + Yarn.

Potential Danger: Tight coupling between frontend and backend could make debugging and upgrades difficult.

Resolution: Separated backend (REST APIs) and frontend (pure UI). Used API Gateway to manage service exposure.

4/15
Situation: Designed the World server response handler.

Potential Danger:

Failing to send ACKs immediately could cause the World server to resend messages.

Duplicate message handling could corrupt server state.

Resolution:

Implemented an AckManager to automatically track and acknowledge all received seqnums.

Used ConcurrentHashMap to ensure thread-safe handling of internal state.

4/16
Situation: Planned a microservices structure: order-service, warehouse-service, api-gateway, and world-connector.

Potential Danger: Communication between microservices could become complicated and error-prone

Resolution: We designed a clear communication pattern by introducing CallbackController endpoints on each service
 and using RestTemplate clients combined with DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for inter-service communication. 

4/18
Situation: Successfully completed end-to-end flow test (buy, pack, load).

Potential Danger: Still need UPS for further testing


4/21
Situation: Built React frontend basic UI for users to place orders.


4/22
Situation: Developed UPS response mechanism.

Potential Danger: Should be carefully follow the agreed spec


4/23
Situation: Refactored the frontend UI.

Using UPS account to track the package

4/25
Situation: Encountered strict action name matching issues while integrating with UPS.

Potential Danger: Incorrect action field names in JSON messages (e.g., typos) would cause UPS servers to reject the requests.

Resolution: Standardized all action names in UPS-related communication. Added detailed request logs for easier debugging.
